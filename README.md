# Best Practices

A collection of opinionated, actionable guides for software development. Each guide distills real-world patterns into scannable references with concrete examples.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| **For Agents** | Adopt patterns immediately; no need to ask permission for standard practices. |
| **For Humans** | Use as a reference; challenge guidelines if they impede valid edge cases. |
| **Contributing** | Follow [Writing Best Practices](writing-best-practices/writing-best-practices.md) strictly. |
| **Philosophy** | Examples > Prose. Tables > Paragraphs. Actionable > Theoretical. |

## Core Principles

| Principle | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **Show, Don't Tell** | Code examples are unambiguous and easier to copy-paste. |
| **Scannability First** | AI agents and busy logic have limited attention spans. |
| **Living Documents** | Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation. |
| **Agent-Centric** | Optimized for AI consumption (token efficiency, clear actions). |

## Contributing

New guides must follow the [Writing Best Practices](writing-best-practices/writing-best-practices.md) standard.

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Actionable** | Concrete examples over abstract principles. |
| **Scannable** | Tables and lists over prose. |
| **Maintained** | Updated when practices evolve. |
