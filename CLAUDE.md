# CLAUDE.md

## Repository Overview

Curated reference documentation for software development best practices.

**Structure:**
- `agents-md/` - Guidelines for AGENTS.md files
- (Future guides will be added as subdirectories)

## Working with This Repo

### Adding New Guides

Each guide should:
1. Live in its own subdirectory (e.g., `git-workflows/`, `code-review/`)
2. Have a main markdown file with comprehensive content
3. Be linked from the root README.md

### Style Conventions

- Use tables for structured information
- Prefer code examples over prose explanations
- Include "Good" and "Bad" examples where applicable
- Keep documents scannable with clear headings

## Boundaries

### Always
- Preserve existing structure and formatting
- Update README.md when adding new guides
- Maintain the actionable, example-driven nature of content

### Ask First
- Adding new guide directories
- Restructuring existing documentation
- Changing organizational approach

### Never
- Remove or significantly alter core guidance without discussion
- Break links between documents
- Add auto-generated filler content
